      <p>As a lifelong dabbler turned full-stack developer, I find joy in taking apart challenges and hatching a solid plan. I look forward to learning from a brilliant team and doing my part to leave every codebase better than I found it. </p>
      <p>I'm an extroverted introvert, and my favorite season is Fall. I make a mean breakfast sandwich</p>

    <h3>Tower of Hanoi</h3>
    <div class="project tower">
      <div class="description">
        <p>The <strong>Tower of Hanoi</strong> is a classic math game/puzzle (read more on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi">Wikipedia</a>). The object of the game is to move the tower from one column to another, following these three rules:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Only one disk may be moved at a time.</li>
          <li>Only the uppermost disk on each stack may be moved from column to column.</li>
          <li>No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Take a minute to Google online versions of the Tower of Hanoi and you'll find a lot of clunky versions built with outdated technology (remember <a href="http://dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex12/towerhanoi.htm">DTML</a>?). I think mine is both easy to use and looks quite nice. I found clicking on columns to be a lot easier than having to drag and drop individual blocks. My version ended up being really well suited to mobile and tablet play.<p>
